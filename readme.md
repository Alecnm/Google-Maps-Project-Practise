# Google maps project 

In my last JS training with Qazi(Clever programmer) I learnt how to build this google maps app which searches Stores by their Zip Code.

Besides, you can see information like:

- Open and close time.
- Telephone number and adress.
- By clicking on the Store's name, you go to the original google maps for more info about location and so forth.

P.S. The number of stores is limited to the little DB the software has itself. Also the Google maps' API is used only for development purposes.
